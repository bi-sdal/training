## Accessing folders

### Outside of Home

Sometimes you might want to naviate outside your home directory.
To do this first click the 3 dots in the files panel to manually input a directory.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="./figs/manual_folder_dir/01-3_dots.png" alt="Go to a specific directory" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:unnamed-chunk-2)Go to a specific directory</p>
</div>

Then you can manually navigate into a different path.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="./figs/manual_folder_dir/02-projects_dir.png" alt="Manually input directory" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:unnamed-chunk-3)Manually input directory</p>
</div>

This example specifically shows navigating to the `/home/sdal/projects` directory.
However, you might want to check your project's `data` folder,
a link to the relevent data folder should already be in there.
