# Infrastructure

We have 2 servers in the lab, `lightfoot` and `snowmane` (named after horses from Lord of the Rings).
The main "production" server is `lightfoot` where all of our data and compute resources exist.

## Components

We use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in our lab.
This allows us to install various components without affecting the underlying server.
A brief history of how we settled on docker and why is in this blog post on [From VMs to LXC Containers to Docker Containers](https://chendaniely.github.io/sdal/2017/07/07/vm_lxc_docker/).

Figure \@ref(fig:docker-lightfoot) depicts what conatiners we have on `lightfoot`.
You can think of each 'container' as an 'application' just like one you are running on your laptop.
But the behvaior of each 'container' is more like a separate server you connect to.

```{r docker-lightfoot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='The Docker infrastructure used in SDAL', fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/sdal_docker_lightfoot.png")
```

The primary conatiners you will be using are the RStudio, Adminer, and Django/Wagtail containers.
They all exist on `lightfoot` and can all be reached in a browser with [`https://analytics.bi.vt.edu`](https://analytics.bi.vt.edu) and an appropriate suffix (e.g., [`/rstudio`](https://analytics.bi.vt.edu/rstudio), [`/db`](https://analytics.bi.vt.edu/db)).

## Accessing Servers

Your main point of contact will be using RStudio on `lightfoot`.
There's a few things that can be setup so you don't have to type your password all the time.
This involves creating "SSH keys".
Aside from creating keys, below is a set of links you'll probably be using all the time:

- Rstudio
    - Your own container: https://analytics.bi.vt.edu/YOUR_PID/rstudio
        - It's suggested you use the container assigned to yourself, since your work and crashed code is isolated from everyone else
    - Generic RStudio container: https://analytics.bi.vt.edu/rstudio
        - There is a generic container that can be used as well,
        it's availiable to you, but if you have an individual conatiner,
        it's better to use that one instead
