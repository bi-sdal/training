# Infrastructure

We have 2 servers in the lab, `lightfoot` and `snowmane` (named after horses from Lord of the Rings).
The main "production" server is `lightfoot` where all of our data and compute resources exist.

## Components

We use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in our lab.
This allows us to install various components without affecting the underlying server.
A brief history of how we settled on docker and why is in this blog post on [From VMs to LXC Containers to Docker Containers](https://chendaniely.github.io/sdal/2017/07/07/vm_lxc_docker/).

Figure \@ref(fig:docker-lightfoot) depicts what conatiners we have on `lightfoot`.
You can think of each 'container' as an 'application' just like one you are running on your laptop.
But the behvaior of each 'container' is more like a separate server you connect to.

```{r docker-lightfoot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='The Docker infrastructure used in SDAL. The containers on the top row are the parts of the system lab members will be connecting to and working on.', fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/sdal_docker_lightfoot.png")
```

The primary conatiners you will be using are the RStudio, Adminer, and Django/Wagtail containers.
They all exist on `lightfoot` and can all be reached in a browser with [`https://analytics.bi.vt.edu`](https://analytics.bi.vt.edu) and an appropriate suffix (e.g., [`/rstudio`](https://analytics.bi.vt.edu/rstudio), [`/db`](https://analytics.bi.vt.edu/db)).

## Accessing Servers

Your main point of contact will be using RStudio on `lightfoot`.
There's a few things that can be setup so you don't have to type your password all the time.
This involves creating "SSH keys".
Aside from creating keys, below is a set of links you'll probably be using all the time:

- Rstudio
    - Your own container: https://analytics.bi.vt.edu/YOUR_PID/rstudio
        - It's suggested you use the container assigned to yourself, since your work and crashed code is isolated from everyone else
    - Generic RStudio container: https://analytics.bi.vt.edu/rstudio
        - There is a generic container that can be used as well,
        it's availiable to you, but if you have an individual conatiner,
        it's better to use that one instead

## Project Template

Why project templates: https://chendaniely.github.io/sdal/2017/05/30/project_templates/

- A template for research projects structured as R packages: https://github.com/Pakillo/template

```
project/             # the project/code repository
|
|- data/             # raw and primary data, are not changed once created
|  |
|  +- *project_data/ # subfolder that links to an encrypted data storage container
|  |  |                    note that nothing here is in the git repository
|  |  |                    it's just a shortcut (i.e., link) to a different folder
|  |  |- original/   # raw data, will not be altered
|  |  |- working/    # intermediate datasets from src code
|  |  +- final/      # final datasets used for analysis/models/plots
|  |
|  +- more_data/     # some projects will need multiple links
|
|- src/              # any programmatic code
|  |- analysis1/     # user1 assigned to the project
|  +- analysis2/     # user2 assigned to the project
|
|- R/                # functions
|
|- tests/            # unit tests
|
|- output            # all output and results from workflows and analyses
|  |- figures/       # graphs, likely designated for manuscript figures
|  |- pictures/      # diagrams, images, and other non-graph graphics
|  +- analysis/      # generated reports for (e.g. rmarkdown output)
|
|- README.md         # the top level description of content
|
|- .gitignore        # git ignore file
|- project.Rproj     # RStudio project
|
|- DESCRIPTION       # Description file to repo into R package, if applicable
+- Makefile          # Makefile, if applicable
```

- you can find our project template `.gitignore` file here: https://github.com/bi-sdal/project_template/blob/master/gitignore

## Getting a project repository

All of our code exist on a GitLab server (https://devlab.vbi.vt.edu)

### Using Terminal

You can use the `SSH` or `HTTPS` link (selected blue text) to run `git clone` to pull down the repository code.
In general this should be cloned into the `git` folder in your home folder.

```bash
cd ~
git clone <REPO URL HERE>
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/get_repo/010-gitlab.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/get_repo/020-get_repo_url.png")
```



### Using RStudio

The steps in RStudio actually do the same thing as the steps from the terminal.

**Find the repository you plan to work on.**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/get_repo/010-gitlab.png")
```

<hr>

**Get the `SSH` url.**

You can also use the `HTTPS` url if you have not setup your SSH keys.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/get_repo/020-get_repo_url.png")
```

<hr>

**File > New Project**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/get_repo/030-new_project.png")
```

<hr>

**Version Control**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/get_repo/040-version_control.png")
```

<hr>

**Git**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/get_repo/050-git.png")
```

<hr>

**Enter repository URL**

Paste in the repository URL from earlier.
The "Project data name" should auto fill itself with the name of the repository (selected in blue text).

It's highly advised to put the project into a folder designated for repositories (e.g., git, Repositories).
You can make sure the project get's `clone`d to the correct place in the "Create project as a subdirectory of" section of the page.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/get_repo/060-paste_screen.png")
```

<hr>

**The loaded project**

RStudio will `git clone` the repository to the designated folder and open the project.
The top right corner will tell you which project you are in.

Make sure you check this everytime you start working.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/get_repo/070-check_project.png")
```
