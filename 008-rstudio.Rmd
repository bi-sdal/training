# RStudio

## Accessing folders

### Outside of Home

Sometimes you might want to naviate outside your home directory.
To do this first click the 3 dots in the files panel to manually input a directory.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Go to a specific directory', fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/manual_folder_dir/01-3_dots.png")
```

Then you can manually navigate into a different path.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Manually input directory', fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/manual_folder_dir/02-projects_dir.png")
```

This example specifically shows navigating to the `/home/sdal/projects` directory.
However, you might want to check your project's `data` folder,
a link to the relevent data folder should already be in there.
